    //Whether the products will "fit" onto our "vehicle" (both of these are 
    //abstract ideas. For example, we can consider our budget a vehicle with
    //limited financial space),

    //What variable costs may arise from transporting a product (beyond the 
    //purchase cost), and

    //If we have a target metric (like a target total mass, or budget), we can
    //use the journey's fixed costs to make a better prediction of a product's 
    //profitability by spreading the fixed costs over the cargo.

    //simultaniously takes up literal volume in the hold, while also taking up
    //an abstract "volume" of the budget available to buy products, as well as
    //possibly reducing the remaining mass that can be packed without changing
