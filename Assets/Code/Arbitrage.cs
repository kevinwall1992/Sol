//An "Arbitrage" represents the price differential of products between a 
//source "market" and a destination "market".

//Upon this foundation, an optimal list of goods to transport between these 
//markets can be created, provided the fixed and variable costs, as well as the
//real and abstract spatial constraints on the journey. (f.e. volume of hold, 
//budget, etc.). 
//Finally, the yearly roi of a journey can be calculated from a list of goods
//and the fixed and variable costs. 

//Note that an Arbitrage can be considered abstractly; one could think 
//of "purchasing" as the variable costs associated with manufacturing a
//product. In that sense, the source "market" may be considered to be your
//factory. Further, if you can put a dollar value on sinking your products
//anywhere, whether it be an actual destination Market, or if you are planning
//on consuming the product yourself, then this class may still be a good fit. 

//The financial terms used throughout this class refer to the journey, not the 
// business as a whole, therefore,
//"fixed costs" refer to fixed costs of the journey, and
//"variable costs" refer to costs that scale with items transported.
//"transport costs" are defined as [variable costs - purchase cost]
